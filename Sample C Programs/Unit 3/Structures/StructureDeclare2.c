// Method 2: Declaring Structure Variables with Definition

#include <stdio.h>

struct Student {
    char name[25];
    int age;
    char branch[10];
    char gender;
} S1, S2;  // Declare variables S1 and S2 with the structure definition

int main() {
    S1.age = 20;  // Example usage of S1
    S2.age = 22;  // Example usage of S2
    return 0;
}

/*

Here, S1 and S2 are declared as variables at the 
same time as the structure Student is defined.

Advantage: This approach combines the definition 
and declaration, which can make the code shorter, 
but it is less flexible. For example, if you need 
more variables later, youâ€™ll need to declare them 
separately, as you did in Method 1.

Note: Structure variables are declared with the 
structure definition, making it concise but less 
flexible for adding new variables of the same 
structure later.
