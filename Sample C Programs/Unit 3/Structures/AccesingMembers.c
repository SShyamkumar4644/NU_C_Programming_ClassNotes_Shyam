/*

Structure Definition:

struct Student is defined with members name, 
age, branch, and gender.

Dot Operator Usage:

s1.age = 18; uses the dot operator to assign 
the value 18 to the age member of s1.

strcpy(s1.name, "Viraaj"); uses strcpy to 
assign a string to the name member, as direct 
assignment isnâ€™t allowed for strings.

Output:

printf("Name of Student 1: %s\n", s1.name); prints the name of s1.
printf("Age of Student 1: %d\n", s1.age); prints the age of s1.
