Definition: A pointer is a special variable that 
holds the memory address of another variable.

Memory Access: Pointers allow direct access to 
memory, enabling efficient data manipulation.

Value Retrieval: You can use pointers to get 
the value of a variable by accessing it through its address.

Multiple Returns: Pointers enable functions to 
return multiple values by using reference parameters.

Memory Addresses: Pointers can be used to 
retrieve and work with the memory addresses of different data types.

Efficiency: Using pointers can reduce the 
amount of memory needed for your program, making 
it simpler and more efficient.

Faster Execution: Programs that use pointers 
often run faster because they can work directly 
with memory rather than copying data around.
