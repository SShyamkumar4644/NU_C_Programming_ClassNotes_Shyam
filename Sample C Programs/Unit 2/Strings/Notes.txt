Strings
- Strings are basically a sequence of characters.
- C does not have a specific data type for strings, 
  so strings are stored in arrays of characters.
- Every string must end with a special character called 
  the null character (`'\0'`) to indicate where the string ends.
- Strings are written inside double quotes (`"Shishir"`), while 
  individual characters are written inside single quotes (`'a'`).
