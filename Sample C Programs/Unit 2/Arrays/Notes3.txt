1. Definition: An array is a collection of similar data types 
stored under a single name.

2. Purpose: When you need multiple variables of the same type, 
using an array is more efficient than creating separate variables.

3. Memory Storage: Arrays store data in contiguous memory locations, 
which allows for efficient access and manipulation.

4. Indexing: Each element in an array is accessed using an 
index, which is a unique number. 
- The first element is at index 0, and the last element is at index (size - 1).

5. Memory Management: Arrays use static memory allocation, 
meaning the memory is allocated at compile time based on the declared size.

6. Size Requirement: The size of an array must be a 
positive integer greater than zero.

7. Data Types: Arrays can hold elements of any 
fundamental data type in C (e.g., int, float, char).
