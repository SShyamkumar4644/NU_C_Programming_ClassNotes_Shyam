1. A one-dimensional array is a list of elements of the same data type 
(like int, float, char, or double) that can be accessed using a single name 
and a single index (subscript).

2. The syntax for declaring an array is:

Data_type Array_name[Size] = {ele1, ele2, ...};

int numbers[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}

- Data_type can be int, float, char, or double.
- Array_name is the name you give to the array.
- Size is how many elements the array can hold.

Examples:

1. float height[10]; declares an array for storing 10 floating-point numbers.
2. int num[50]; declares an array for storing 50 integers.
3. char name[20]; declares an array for storing 20 characters (like a string).
4. double a[80]; declares an array for 80 double-precision numbers.
Subscript Rules:

1. Subscripts must be non-negative integers.

2. You cannot use a subscript of a subscript (e.g., array[array[0]] is not allowed).

3. For strings, remember to reserve an extra space for the null terminator \0, which indicates the end of the string.
