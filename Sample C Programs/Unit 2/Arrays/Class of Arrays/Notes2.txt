1. Initialization means assigning values to the elements of an array when you 
declare it.

2. All initial values must be constant (like numbers) and cannot be variables or 
the result of function calls.

3. The syntax for initializing a one-dimensional array is:

Data_type array_name[size] = {ele1, ele2, ...};

int names[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}       

- Data_type can be int, float, char, etc.
- array_name is the name of the array.
- size is the maximum number of elements, and the values 
are enclosed in curly braces.
