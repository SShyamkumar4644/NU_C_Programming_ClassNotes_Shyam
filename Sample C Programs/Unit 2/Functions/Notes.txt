1. Predefined Functions  
   - These are functions that are already available in C libraries, and 
   you can use them without writing their code. 
   - They are part of the standard library, like `printf()` for printing output 
   and `scanf()` for reading input. 
   - Predefined functions are designed to make common tasks 
   easier, so you donâ€™t need to implement them yourself.
   Example: `printf()`, `scanf()`, `sqrt()`

2. User-Defined Functions  
   - These are functions that you create to perform specific 
   tasks in your program. 
   - You define them according to your 
   needs, including the name, parameters, and what the 
   function will do. 
   - By creating user-defined functions, 
   you can organize your code better, reuse parts of your 
   code, and make it more readable.

   Example: You can create a function to add two numbers, 
   calculate the area of a circle, etc.
